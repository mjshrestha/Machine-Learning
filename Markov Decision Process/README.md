## Markov Decision Processes

In this project, two types of MDP problems were solved using three different algorithms â€“ two planning algorithms i.e, Value Iteration, Policy Iteration and one reinforcement learning algorithm i.e, Q-Learning and the results from the algorithms were compared. The two problems include one non-grid problem i.e., forest management and another grid problem - finding the route in a departmental store floor plan design. The non-grid problem was solved using Mdptoolbox [[1](https://github.com/sawcordwell/pymdptoolbox)] and the grid problem used Grid World implementation from the Brown-UMBC Reinforcement Learning and Planning Java open-source library [[2](https://github.com/jmacglashan/burlap)]
